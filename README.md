# Madakaripura

A lightweight and configurable middleware service that acts as a dynamic outbound gateway between core systems and third-party partner APIs.

## ğŸš€ Overview

The **Madakaripura** decouples your internal core system from external partner APIs by handling:

- Request transformation (core format â†’ partner-specific)
- Forwarding logic with configurable endpoints and headers
- Response transformation (partner â†’ core format)
- Retry, timeout, and logging

This pattern is ideal for B2B integrations where each partner has their own API structure, headers, and behavior.
